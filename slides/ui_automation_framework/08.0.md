# Avoid these anti patterns

- Webdriver methods in tests/page objects
- Assertions in page objects
- Long E2E tests with multiple actions and assertions
- UI tests exposing interactions with web elements
- Writing too much UI automation ðŸ’¡ _Less is more_
- Use UI automation to replace manual testing
