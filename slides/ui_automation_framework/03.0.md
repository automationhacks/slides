# Choosing a test framework ⚙️

Some of the available tool choices

| Type        | JVM (Java/Kotlin) | Python             |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| xUnit style | JUnit, TestNG     | pytest, unittest   |
| BDD         | Cucumber          | Behave, pytest-bdd |

Ask yourself:

- Who would be the primary **author** of the tests?
  - Are they Developers, Automation engineers (XUnit)
  - Are they Product managers, Manual testers (BDD)
