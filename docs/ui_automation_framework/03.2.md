# BDD 🤝

## Benefits ➕

- Readable (Gherkin syntax with `Given/When/Then/And`)
- Accessible to PM/Test engineers
- Provides a layer to allow non-coders to also contribute
- Generally a more readable report

## Tradeoffs ➖

- Maintaining a BDD layer (feature files, step definitions) can be an overhead
- Less flexible
- Difficult to implement parallelization (can only do at Feature file level)
- Easy to write imperative instead of declarative feature files
