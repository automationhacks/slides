# Choosing a test framework and assertion lib ⚙️

| Type        | JVM (Java/Kotlin) | Python             |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| xUnit style | JUnit, TestNG     | pytest, unittest   |
| BDD         | Cucumber          | Behave, pytest-bdd |

Think ! 🤔️ Who would be the primary **author** of these tests?

- Developers, Automation engineers (Choose xUnit)?
- Product managers (PM), Manual testers (BDD **can be** an option)?

## xUnit style 🤖

**Benefits** ➕

- Fast and flexible
- Setup/tear downs at different levels (Suite, Class, Test)
- Easy to **data drive/parallelize** tests

**Tradeoffs** ➖

- Can be less readable (if not well designed)

> Tip: 💡 Write tests using [arrange-act-assert](http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert) pattern.

## BDD 🤝

> If you think Cucumber is a testing tool, please read on, because you are wrong. - Aslak Hellesøy
> Reference:
> [The worlds most misunderstood collaboration tool](https://cucumber.io/blog/collaboration/the-worlds-most-misunderstood-collaboration-tool/)

**Benefits** ➕

- Readable (Gherkin syntax with `Given/When/Then/And`)
- Provides a layer to allow non-coders (PM/Manual test engineers) to also contribute
- More readable test results report

**Tradeoffs** ➖

- Maintaining a BDD layer (feature files, step definitions) can be an overhead
- Less flexible
- (Trap 👺) Feature files can be **imperative** instead of **declarative**

### Imperative

```text
Given I open a browser
And I navigate to http://example.com/login
When I type in the username field bob97
And I type in the password field F1d0
And I click on Submit button
Then I should see the message Welcome Back Bob
```

### Declarative

```text
Given I am on the Login Page
When I sign in with correct credentials
Then I should see a welcome message
```
