# Avoid these anti patterns

## Assertions in page objects 📃

- Asserts should be tests responsibility
  > Only a single assert that verifies page/elements are loaded properly ✅

## Webdriver methods in tests/page objects

> If you have WebDriver APIs in your test methods, You're Doing It Wrong. -- Simon Stewart.

- Follow DRY (Don't repeat yourself) ⚔️ 🔁
- Put common wrappers in a `BasePage` class

## Long E2E tests with multiple actions and assertions

- Debugging nightmare 😱
- Might cause bugs to be discovered later if earlier steps fails

## Writing too much UI automation

> 💡 **Less is more**

- **DO NOT** test everything from the app
- Prefer to write API/Integration/Unit tests instead
- Exploratory testing will always be irreplaceable
