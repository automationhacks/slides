# Avoid these anti patterns

## Don't put Assertions in page objects 📃

- Asserts should be tests responsibility
  > Only a single assert that verifies page/elements are loaded properly ✅

## Don't put Webdriver methods in tests/page objects

- Follow DRY (Don't repeat yourself) ⚔️ 🔁
- Put common wrappers in a `BasePage` class

## Long E2E tests with multiple actions and assertions

- Debugging nightmare 😱
- Might cause bugs to be discovered later if earlier steps fails

## Don't write Tests exposing interactions with web elements

- Tests should be all about the feature/functionality
- Use page objects 👍

## Writing too much UI automation

> 💡 **Less is more**

- **DO NOT** test everything from the app
- Prefer to write API/Integration/Unit tests instead

## Use UI automation to replace manual testing

- Exploratory testing will always be irreplaceable

## Avoid using soft assertions

- Write an assert to fail fast
- Do not write soft assertions

## Using BDD only for gherkin

- Avoid using Cucumber/Serenity/SpecFlow to **do BDD**, if you are not going to follow the
  methodology
