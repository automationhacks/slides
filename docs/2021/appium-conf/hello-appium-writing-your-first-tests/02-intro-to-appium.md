### Client server

Appium is a **web server** that exposes **REST APIs**

Typical flow

- Server receives connection from client
- Server listens for commands
- Client makes a request to Server which gets executed on device
- Server returns an HTTP response

### Session

- Each action happens within a **sessions** context
- We start a session with a `Desired capabilities` object to specify the type of connection we want

### Desired capabilities

- **Hash map** with key being different capabilities and values with specific configurations

### Appium Server

- `Node.js` server that bridges commands to native frameworks from vendors (Google, Apple)

### Appium Clients

- Clients that adhere to **WebDriver protocol** and exposes actions
- Test code uses these clients to perform desired actions on devices

### Appium Desktop

- Desktop app to support identifying elements and aid writing automated tests
