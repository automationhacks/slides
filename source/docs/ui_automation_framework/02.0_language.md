# Choosing a language ✏️

Available choices

- Statically typed: Java, Kotlin, C#, TypeScript
  - Compile time feedback. Yay! 🙌
- Dynamically typed: Python, JS, Ruby
  - Flexible and quick to author tests (🤞 Without types 😄)

## How to decide 🤔

- Try to choose a language that **devs also use**
  > Quality **should be** the whole team's responsibility
- Easy to learn and to find skilled people in
- Undergoing active development and has a thriving community
- Well defined ecosystem of tools/libraries

## Can't really go wrong with 👍
