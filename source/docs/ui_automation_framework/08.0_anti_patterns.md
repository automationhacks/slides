# Avoid these anti patterns

## Don't put Assertions in page objects üìÉ

- Asserts should be tests responsibility
  > Single assert at the beginning that correct page/elements are loaded ‚úÖ

## Webdriver methods in tests/page objects

- Follow DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
- Put common wrappers in a `BasePage` class

## Long E2E tests with multiple actions and assertions

- Recipe for disaster
- Write atomic tests

## UI tests exposing interactions with web elements

- Tests should be all about the feature/functionality that we want to test
- Do not write code to interact with elements in tests
- Use page objects üëç

## Writing too much UI automation

- üí° **Less is more**
- **DO NOT** test everything from the app
- Write API tests instead
- Write integration tests instead
- Write unit tests instead

## Use UI automation to replace manual testing

- Exploratory testing will always be valuable

## Avoid using soft assertions

- Write an assert to fail fast
- Do not write soft assertions

## Using BDD only for gherkin

- Avoid using Cucumber/Serenity/SpecFlow to **do BDD**, if you are not going to follow the
  methodology
